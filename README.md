# chattinogame
Just for fun, I started making a "Flappy Bird" style game in Python. It's themed after popular streamer Raora, and her character Chattino. I'm just doing this for the experience, I may never finish it, but I wanted a repository available so I can share with friends. Feel free to take/use/modify this however you want.
