# chattinogame
Just for fun, I started making a "Flappy Bird" style game in Python. It's themed after popular streamer Raora, and her character Chattino. I'm just doing this for the experience, I may never finish it, but I wanted a repository available so I can share with friends. Feel free to take/use/modify this however you want. 

# Jetpack Escape

A fast-paced, jetpack-powered arcade game inspired by Flappy Bird, but with dynamic obstacles, an enemy AI, and a unique tunnel mechanic. Developed for fun and learning, with plans for original assets in the future.

## Game Description

**Jetpack Escape** challenges you to guide your character through a series of gates and obstacles, avoiding both static hazards and a dynamic enemy that lunges in unpredictable ways. Survive as long as you can, rack up your score, and master the tunnel at the bottom of the screen for extra challenge!

### Game Goals
- Pass through as many gates as possible to increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with obstacles and the enemy.
- Survive as long as you can and set a high score!

## Installation & Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pygame** (for local play)
- **pygbag** (for web build)

### Install for Local Play
```sh
pip install pygame
```

### Install for Web Build

## How to Play

- Use the **Spacebar** to jump and control your jetpack-powered character.
- Navigate through the gates and avoid obstacles.
- After clearing 3 gates, an enemy will appear and lunge in various patterns as you progress.
- Entering the tunnel at the bottom is riskyâ€”avoid obstacles there for a higher score.
